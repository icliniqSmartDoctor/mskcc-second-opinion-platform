      MSK experts strive to lead the way in every stage of the research process.
      All treatment options for cancer patients available today started with the
      early phase (phase I study) of a clinical trial.

      Early phase trials of promising new medicines for solid tumors in the body
      of adult and pediatric cancer patients are conducted by MSK's Early Drug
      Development (EDD) Service. They run early phase clinical trials across
      disease types and molecular targets. Early Drug Development Service aims
      to
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>
        Provide MSK patients the opportunity to access the latest drugs for
        specific cancer or cancer mutation at the earliest.
      </li>
      <li>
        Determine the optimal safe doses to start with later phases (phase II
        and phase III) and advance the research and development of new treatment
        modalities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow rapid evaluation of drugs showing promising results using advanced
        clinical trial designs like basket trials. This targets a specific
        genetic mutation in various tumors from different cancer types.

            <span class="font-semibold">Experience </span> - MSK, Memorial Sloan Kettering
            Cancer Center, was among the first institutions to receive the designation
            of a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center
            in 1971. More than 600 clinical trials in different research phases for
            various types of cancer are currently ongoing at MSK. From these clinical
            trials, the EDD team is conducting around 35 early phase studies.

            <span class="font-semibold"> Large Patient Groups</span> - Early phase
            trials need a substantial number of volunteers. As MSK is a high-volume
            cancer center, patients with many disease types and rare cancers get
            enrolled in the trials. MSK's comprehensive care facilities at many regional
            sites have made the recruitment and study start-up more convenient and
            faster. For trials requiring more significant numbers of volunteers,
            MSK leads and participates in multisite trials and collaborates with
            other cancer centers.
