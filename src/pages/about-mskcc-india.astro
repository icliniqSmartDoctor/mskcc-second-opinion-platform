				Bold Innovations that allow for more precision in identifying

			</h4>
			<p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
				We believe that immunotherapy is one of the most promising ways
				to treat, cure, and ultimately prevent cancer
			</p>
			<ul class="list-disc mx-10 mt-3 leading-7 text-gray-700">
				<li>
					Immunotherapy studies began at MSK more than a century ago
				</li>
				<li>
					Our physician-scientists have been at the forefront in
					implementing groundbreaking immune therapies, including
					(CAR) T cell therapy and the development of drugs known as
					checkpoint inhibitors
				</li>
				<li>
					For some cancers, this can be a highly effective alternative
					to chemotherapy
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
				MSK scientists created MSK-IMPACT®, (for Integrated Mutation
				Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets) a targeted tumor
				sequencing test designed to detect gene mutations and other
				critical genetic aberrations in both rare and common cancers.
			</p>
			<ul class="list-disc mx-10 mt-3 leading-7 text-gray-700">
				<li>
					MSK patients around the world can send their tissue samples
					to MSK This test, available exclusively to MSK patients, can
					provide results that help rule out treatments options that
					may be ineffective and potentially lead to new therapies
					targeting genetic mutations
